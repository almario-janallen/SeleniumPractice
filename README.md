# SeleniumPractice

Basic Java + Selenium project for automation practice.

### ðŸ”— Tech Stack
- Java 17+
- Maven
- Selenium 4.21.0
- ChromeDriver
- IntelliJ IDEA

## Progress Milestones

### âœ… Day 1: Environment Setup & First Selenium Test
- Installed JDK, Maven, IntelliJ IDEA, ChromeDriver
- Created Maven project and ran a basic Selenium test to open a browser and fetch page title

### âœ… Days 2-3: Java Basics & Control Structures
- Practiced variables, data types, operators, loops, and conditionals with example programs

### âœ… Day 4: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Created classes and objects
- Implemented methods, constructors, and basic interactions with object properties

### âœ… Day 5: Inheritance and Polymorphism
- Created a base Vehicle class and extended it with a Car subclass
- Used super to call the superclass constructor and override methods
- Demonstrated runtime polymorphism using a Vehicle array containing different object types
- Practiced method overriding and object-oriented design principles

### âœ… Day 6: Collections & Exception Handling
- Learned how to use ArrayList and the differences between arrays and ArrayList
- Practiced removing elements and handling reindexing
- Introduced exception handling using try-catch-finally
- Created and used custom exceptions for realistic QA scenarios

### âœ… Day 7: File I/O with QA Context
- Read test case results from a file using BufferedReader
- Wrote a test summary report and logged errors using BufferedWriter
- Integrated custom exceptions for input validation (e.g., InvalidTestResultException)

### âœ… Day 8: Selenium Setup & First Automated Test
- Configured Selenium WebDriver with Java and Maven
- Ran a test that opens a browser, visits a site, and prints the page title
- Practiced basic test execution flow and browser teardown

## How to Run

1. Clone this repo  
2. Set up ChromeDriver path in your system or project  
3. Use Maven to build and run tests  
4. Run Java classes with main methods for individual practice examples  

## Next Steps
- Selenium WebDriver commands and locators  
- Handling waits, interactions, and alerts  
- Building test frameworks with TestNG  
- Real-world automation projects (DemoBlaze, SauceDemo)
